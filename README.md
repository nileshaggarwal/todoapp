This To-Do Notes App project was done as an internship assignment task.It is made using useState() and useEffect() hook of React and no ecternal dependency has been used. It actually allows a person to enter his name as username and can save his tasks which are currently saved into localStorage so even if user refreshes or closes and checks the website on the same device his to-do task can be found. If user wants to change his username he can do that by clicking on 'change user?' and hence the to-do list will also reset.
